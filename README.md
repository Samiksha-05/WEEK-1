# Plastic Waste Classification using CNN:

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of plastic waste into various categories. The model aims to help automate the process of identifying and categorizing plastic waste, which can be beneficial for waste management, recycling efforts, and environmental sustainability initiatives.

Objective:

- Classify different types of plastic waste (e.g., plastic bottles, bags, containers) using deep learning techniques.
- Contribute to the environmental cause by automating plastic waste detection and facilitating recycling processes.
  
Key Features:

- Dataset: A curated dataset containing labeled images of different types of plastic waste.
- Model Architecture: A CNN model designed for accurate image classification.
- Goal: Enhance efficiency in waste sorting and promote effective recycling processes.
