# Waste Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
Waste classification is a crucial step toward effective waste management and environmental sustainability. This project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify waste into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model can automatically analyze images of waste and categorize them with high accuracy.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand the importance of **waste classification** in waste management.
- Learn how to apply **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- Utilize **data augmentation** to enhance model performance.
- Implement **model evaluation** techniques using accuracy and loss metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow & Keras** for deep learning
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **ImageDataGenerator** for real-time data augmentation

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Preprocessing images from the dataset.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Enhancing model generalization.
3. **CNN Model Architecture**: Building a deep learning model with multiple convolutional layers.
4. **Model Training**: Training the model on classified waste images.
5. **Evaluation & Testing**: Measuring model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
6. **Prediction**: Classifying new waste images into respective categories.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
The lack of proper waste classification contributes to **environmental pollution** and inefficient recycling. Manually sorting waste is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to **automate waste classification** using **deep learning** to improve waste segregation efficiency.

## 💡 Solution
A **CNN-based classification model** is trained to distinguish between **organic** and **recyclable waste** using image data. The model is designed to:
✔️ Accurately classify waste images.
✔️ Provide an efficient and scalable solution for automated waste sorting.
✔️ Aid in better waste disposal practices for a cleaner environment.

## 📈 Model Performance
- Achieved high accuracy in training and validation.
- Effective waste classification using a deep learning model.
- Graphical representations of **accuracy** and **loss trends** over training epochs.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Extend classification to **more waste categories** (e.g., hazardous, electronic waste).
- Deploy the model as a **web application** for real-time predictions.
- Improve model accuracy with **transfer learning** techniques.

## 🎨 Sample Visualization
